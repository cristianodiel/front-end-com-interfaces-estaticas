        <p>Chess openings are primarily categorized by move sequences. In the initial position, White has twenty
            legal moves. Of these, 1.e4, 1.d4, 1.Nf3, and 1.c4 are by far the most popular as these moves do the
            most to promote rapid development and control of the center. A few other opening moves are considered
            reasonable but less consistent with opening principles than the four most popular moves. The Dunst
            Opening, 1.Nc3, develops a knight to a good square, but is somewhat inflexible because it blocks White's
            c-pawn; also, after 1...d5 the knight is liable to be driven to an inferior square by ...d4. (Note that
            after 1.Nf3 the analogous 1...e5? loses a pawn.) Bird's Opening, 1.f4, addresses center control but not
            development and weakens the king position slightly. The Sokolsky Opening 1.b4 and the King's and Queen's
            fianchettos: Larsen's Opening 1.b3 and 1.g3 aid development a bit, but they only address center control
            peripherally and are slower than the more popular openings. The eleven remaining possibilities are
            rarely played at the top levels of chess. Of these, the best are merely slow such as 1.c3, 1.d3, and
            1.e3. Worse possibilities either ignore the center and development such as 1.a3, weaken White's position
            (for instance, 1.f3 and 1.g4), or place the knights on poor squares (1.Na3 and 1.Nh3).</p><br>

        <p>Black has twenty complementary responses to White's opening move. Many of these are mirror images of the
            most popular first moves for White, but with one less tempo. Defenses beginning with 1...c6 and 1...e6,
            often followed by the center thrust 2...d5, are also popular. Defenses with an early ...d6 coupled with
            a kingside fianchetto are also commonly played.</p><br>

        <p>The most important scheme of classifying chess openings for serious players is by ECO code, a series of
            500 opening codes assigned by the Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings. Although these codes are invaluable
            for the serious study of the chess opening, they are not very practical for a broad survey of the chess
            opening as the codes obscure common structural features between related openings.</p><br>

        <p>A simple descriptive categorization of the chess opening is King's Pawn Openings, Queen's Pawn Openings,
            and Others. Since these categories are still individually very large, it is common to divide each of
            them further. One reasonable way to group the openings is:<br><br></p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Double King Pawn, Symmetric or Open Games (1.e4 e5)
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Single King Pawn or Semi-Open Games (1.e4 other)
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Double Queen Pawn or Closed Games (1.d4 d5)
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Single Queen Pawn or Semi-Closed Games (1.d4 other)
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Flank openings (including 1.c4, 1.Nf3, 1.f4, and others)
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Unusual first moves for White
            </li>


        </ul><br>

        <p>The Indian systems (1.d4 Nf6) are the most important of the Semi-Closed Games, and warrant separate
            treatment.</p><br><br>

    <div class="text5A">

        <h2>Open Games 1.e4 e5</h2><br>

        <p>White starts by playing 1.e4 (moving their king pawn two spaces). This is the most popular opening move
            and it has many strengths—it immediately works on controlling the center, and it frees two pieces (the
            queen and a bishop). The oldest openings in chess follow 1.e4. Bobby Fischer rated 1.e4 as "Best by
            test." On the downside, 1.e4 places a pawn on an undefended square and weakens d4 and f4. If Black
            mirrors White's move and replies with 1...e5, the result is an open game.</p><br>

        <p>The most popular second move for White is 2.Nf3 attacking Black's king pawn, preparing for a kingside
            castle, and anticipating the advance of the queen pawn to d4. Black's most common reply is 2...Nc6,
            which usually leads to the Ruy Lopez (3.Bb5), Scotch Game (3.d4), or Italian Game (3.Bc4). If Black
            instead maintains symmetry and counterattacks White's center with 2...Nf6 then the Petrov's Defense
            results. The Philidor Defense (2...d6) is not popular in modern chess because it allows White an easy
            space advantage while Black's position remains cramped and passive, although solid. Other responses to
            2.Nf3 are not seen in master play.</p><br>

            <p>Open Game</p>
        </div>

        <p>The most popular alternatives to 2.Nf3 are the Vienna Game (2.Nc3), the Bishop's Opening (2.Bc4), and the
            King's Gambit (2.f4). These openings have some similarities with each other, in particular the Bishop's
            Opening frequently transposes to variations of the Vienna Game. The King's Gambit was extremely popular
            in the 19th century. White sacrifices a pawn for quick development and to pull a black pawn out of the
            center. The Vienna Game also frequently features attacks on the Black center by means of a f2–f4 pawn
            advance.</p><br>

        <p>In the Center Game (2.d4) White immediately opens the center but if the pawn is to be recovered after
            2...exd4, White must contend with a slightly premature queen development after 3.Qxd4. An alternative is
            to sacrifice one or two pawns, for example in the Danish Gambit.</p><br>

        <h2>Semi-open games: 1.e4, Black plays other than 1...e5</h2><br>

        <p>In the semi-open games White plays 1.e4 and Black breaks symmetry immediately by replying with a move
            other than 1...e5. The most popular Black defense to 1.e4 is the Sicilian (1...c5), but the French
            (1...e6, normally followed by 2.d4 d5) and the Caro–Kann (1...c6, normally followed by 2.d4 d5) are also
            very popular. The Pirc and the Modern are closely related openings that are also often seen, while the
            Alekhine and the Scandinavian have made occasional appearances in World Chess Championship games.</p>
        <br>

        <p>The Sicilian and French Defenses lead to unbalanced positions that can offer exciting play with both
            sides having chances to win. The Caro–Kann Defense is solid as Black intends to use their c-pawn to
            support their center (1.e4 c6 2.d4 d5). Alekhine's, the Pirc and the Modern are hypermodern openings in
            which Black tempts White to build a large center with the goal of attacking it with pieces.</p><br>

        <h2>Closed games: 1.d4 d5</h2><br>

        <p>The openings classified as closed games begin 1.d4 d5. The move 1.d4 offers the same benefits to
            development and center control as does 1.e4, but unlike with King Pawn openings where the e4-pawn is
            undefended after the first move, the d4-pawn is protected by White's queen. This slight difference has a
            tremendous effect on the opening. For instance, whereas the King's Gambit is rarely played today at the
            highest levels of chess, the Queen's Gambit remains a popular weapon at all levels of play. Also,
            compared with the King Pawn openings, transpositions among variations are more common and critical in
            the closed games.</p><br>
        <div class="text5B">
            <img src="OpenGame.png" alt="Open Game"><br>
            <p>Open Game</p>
        </div>

        <p>The most important closed openings are in the Queen's Gambit family (White plays 2.c4). The Queen's
            Gambit is somewhat misnamed, since White can always regain the offered pawn if desired. In the Queen's
            Gambit Accepted, Black plays ...dxc4, giving up the center for free development and the chance to try to
            give White an isolated queen pawn with a subsequent ...c5 and ...cxd4. White will get active pieces and
            possibilities for the attack. Black has two popular ways to decline the pawn, the Slav (2...c6) and the
            Queen's Gambit Declined (2...e6). Both of these moves lead to an immense forest of variations that can
            require a great deal of opening study to play well. Among the many possibilities in the Queen's Gambit
            Declined are the Orthodox Defense, Lasker's Defense, the Cambridge Springs Defense, the Tartakower
            Variation, and the Tarrasch and Semi-Tarrasch Defenses. Black replies to the Queen's Gambit other than
            2...dxc4, 2...c6, and 2...e6 are uncommon.</p><br>


        <p>The Colle System and Stonewall Attack are classified as Queen's Pawn Games because White plays d4 but not
            c4. They are also examples of Systems, rather than specific opening variations. White develops aiming
            for a particular formation without great concern over how Black chooses to defend. Both systems are
            popular with club players because they are easy to learn, but are rarely used by professionals because a
            well-prepared opponent playing Black can equalize fairly easily. The Stonewall is characterized by the
            White pawn formation on c3, d4, e3, and f4, and can be achieved by several move orders and against many
            different Black setups. The diagram positions and the move sequences given below are typical.</p><br>

        <h2>Indian defenses: 1.d4 Nf6</h2><br>

            <img src="IndianDefense.png" alt="Indian Defense"><br>
            <p>Indian Defense</p>
        </div>
        <p>The Indian systems are asymmetrical defenses to 1.d4 that employ hypermodern chess strategy. Fianchettos
            are common in many of these openings. As with the closed games, transpositions are important and many of
            the Indian defenses can be reached by several different move orders. Although Indian defenses were
            championed in the 1920s by players in the hypermodern school, they were not fully accepted until Soviet
            players showed in the late 1940s that these systems are sound for Black. Since then, Indian defenses
            have been the most popular Black replies to 1.d4 because they offer an unbalanced game with chances for
            both sides. The usual White second move is 2.c4, grabbing a larger share of the center and allowing the
            move Nc3, to prepare for moving the e-pawn to e4 without blocking the c-pawn. Black's most popular
            replies are:</p><br>

        <ul>
            <li>
                2...e6, freeing the king's bishop and leading into the Nimzo-Indian Defense, Queen's Indian Defense,
                Bogo–Indian Defense, Modern Benoni, or regular lines of the Queen's Gambit Declined,
            </li>
            <li>
                2...g6, preparing a fianchetto of the king's bishop and entering the King's Indian Defense or
                Grünfeld Defense, and
            </li>
            <li>
                2...c5 3.d5 e6, the Modern Benoni, with an immediate counterpunch in the center.
            </li>

        </ul><br><br>

        <p>Advocated by Nimzowitsch as early as 1913, the Nimzo-Indian Defense was the first of the Indian systems
            to gain full acceptance. It remains one of the most popular and well-respected defenses to 1.d4 and
            White often adopts move orders designed to avoid it. Black attacks the center with pieces and is
            prepared to trade a bishop for a knight to weaken White's queenside with doubled pawns.</p><br>



        <p>The King's Indian Defense is aggressive, somewhat risky, and generally indicates that Black will not be
            satisfied with a draw. Although it was played occasionally as early as the late 19th century, the King's
            Indian was considered inferior until the 1940s, when it was taken up by Bronstein, Boleslavsky, and
            Reshevsky. Despite being Fischer's favored defense to 1.d4, its popularity faded in the mid-1970s.
            Kasparov's successes with the defense restored the King's Indian to prominence in the 1980s.</p><br>

        <p>Ernst Grünfeld debuted the Grünfeld Defense in 1922. Distinguished by the move 3...d5, Grünfeld intended
            it as an improvement to the King's Indian which was not considered entirely satisfactory at that time.
            The Grünfeld has been adopted by World Champions Smyslov, Fischer, and Kasparov.</p><br>

        <p>The Queen's Indian Defense is considered solid, safe, and perhaps somewhat drawish. Black often chooses
            the Queen's Indian when White avoids the Nimzo-Indian by playing 3.Nf3 instead of 3.Nc3. Black
            constructs a sound position that makes no positional concessions, although sometimes it is difficult for
            Black to obtain good winning chances. Karpov was a leading expert in this opening.</p><br>

        <p>The Modern Benoni is a risky attempt by Black to unbalance the position and gain active piece play at the
            cost of allowing White a pawn wedge at d5 and a central majority. Tal popularized the defense in the
            1960s by winning several brilliant games with it, and Fischer occasionally adopted it, with good
            results, including a win in his 1972 world championship match against Boris Spassky. Often Black adopts
            a slightly different move order, playing 2...e6 before 3...c5 in order to avoid the sharpest lines for
            White.</p><br>

        <p>The Benko Gambit is often played by strong players, and is very popular at lower levels. Black plays to
            open lines on the queenside where White will be subject to considerable pressure. If White accepts the
            gambit, Black's compensation is positional rather than tactical, and their initiative can last even
            after many piece exchanges and well into the endgame. White often chooses instead either to decline the
            gambit pawn or return it.</p><br>

        <p>The Catalan Opening is characterized by White forming a pawn center at d4 and c4 and fianchettoing their
            king's bishop. It resembles a combination of the Queen's Gambit and Réti Opening. Since the Catalan can
            be reached from many different move orders, (one Queen's Gambit Declined-like move sequence is 1.d4 d5
            2.c4 e6 3.Nf3 Nf6 4.g3), it is sometimes called the Catalan System.</p><br>

        <h2>Other Black responses to 1.d4</h2><br>

        <p>Of the defenses to 1.d4 other than 1...d5 and 1...Nf6, the most important are the Dutch Defense and the
            Benoni Defense. The Dutch, an aggressive defense adopted for a time by World Champions Alekhine and
            Botvinnik, and played by both Botvinnik and challenger David Bronstein in their 1951 world championship
            match, is still played occasionally at the top level by Short and others. Another fairly common opening is
            the Benoni Defense, which may become very wild if it develops into the Modern Benoni, though other
            variations are more solid.</p><br>

        <p>Several other uncommon semi-closed openings have been named and studied, see Semi-Closed Game for details.
        </p><br>

        </ul><br><br>


        <h2>Flank openings (including English, Réti, Bird's, and White fianchettos)</h2><br>

        <p>The flank openings are the group of White openings typified by play on one or both flanks. White plays in
            hypermodern style, attacking the center from the flanks with pieces rather than occupying it with pawns.
            These openings are played often, and 1.Nf3 and 1.c4 trail only 1.e4 and 1.d4 in popularity as opening moves.
        </p><br>

        <p>If White opens with 1.Nf3, the game often becomes one of the d4 openings (closed games or semi-closed games)
            by a different move order (this is called transposition), but unique openings such as the Réti and King's
            Indian Attack are also common. The Réti itself is characterized by White playing 1.Nf3, fianchettoing one or
            both bishops, and not playing an early d4 (which would generally transpose into one of the 1.d4 openings).
        </p><br>

        <p>The King's Indian Attack (KIA) is a system of development that White may use in reply to almost any Black
            opening moves. The characteristic KIA setup is 1.Nf3, 2.g3, 3.Bg2, 4.0-0, 5.d3, 6.Nbd2, and 7.e4, although
            these moves may be played in many different orders. In fact, the KIA is probably most often reached after
            1.e4 when White uses it to respond to a Black attempt to play one of the semi-open games such as the
            Caro–Kann, French, or Sicilian, or even the open games which usually come after 1.e4 e5. Its greatest appeal
            may be that by adopting a set pattern of development, White can avoid the large amount of opening study
            required to prepare to meet the many different possible Black replies to 1.e4.</p><br>

        <p>The English Opening (1.c4) also frequently transposes into a d4 opening, but it can take on independent
            character as well including the Symmetrical Variation (1.c4 c5) and the Reversed Sicilian (1.c4 e5).</p><br>

        <p>Larsen's Opening (1.b3) and the Sokolsky Opening (1.b4) are occasionally seen in grandmaster play. Benko used
            1.g3 to defeat both Fischer and Tal in the 1962 Candidates Tournament in Curaçao.</p><br>

        <p>With Bird's Opening (1.f4) White tries to get a strong grip on the e5-square. The opening can resemble a
            Dutch Defense in reverse after 1.f4 d5, or Black may try to disrupt White by playing 1...e5!? (From's
            Gambit).</p><br>

        <h2>Unusual first moves for White</h2><br>

        <p>First moves other than the king pawn (1.e4), queen pawn (1.d4), or flank openings (1.b3, 1.b4, 1.c4, 1.Nf3,
            1.f4, or 1.g3) are not regarded as effective ways to exploit White's first-move advantage and thus are
            rarely played. Although some of these openings are not actually bad for White, each of the twelve remaining
            possible first moves suffers one or more of the following defects compared to the more popular choices:</p>
        <br>


        <ul>
            <li>
                too passive for White (1.d3, 1.e3, 1.c3, or 1.Nc3)
            </li>
            <li>
                gratuitously weakens White's position (1.f3 or 1.g4)
            </li>
            <li>
                does little to aid White's development or control the center (1.a3, 1.a4, 1.h3, or 1.h4)
            </li>
            <li>
                develops a knight to an inferior square (1.Na3 or 1.Nh3)
            </li>
